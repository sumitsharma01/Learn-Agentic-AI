    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to enable machines to mimic human intelligence ‚Äî learning from data, making decisions, recognizing patterns, and solving problems. But how do we replicate \"intelligence\" in a machine?\n",

    "At the heart of many AI systems, especially Deep Learning, lies the neural network, inspired by how our brain works.\n",
